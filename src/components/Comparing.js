				The three branches of government in the United States each have their
				own distinct responsibilities and operate independently from one
				another, but their successes are interdependent. The concept of checks
				and balances and the separation of powers ensures that no single branch
				becomes too powerful and that each branch has the ability to limit the
				power of the others. For example, the legislative branch has the power
				to make laws, but the executive branch has the power to veto those laws,
				and the judicial branch has the power to interpret laws and ensure they
				are in accordance with the Constitution. This interplay between the
				branches creates a balance of power, preventing any one branch from
				dominating the others. By working together, the three branches ensure
				that the government operates in an effective and democratic manner, with
				each branch serving as a check on the power of the others.
