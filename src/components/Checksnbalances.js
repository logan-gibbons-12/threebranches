				Checks and balances is a system in the US federal government that
				ensures that no one branch of government becomes too powerful. This
				system allows each branch to limit the powers of the other two branches,
				creating a balance of power among them. This system of checks and
				balances helps to ensure that no one branch of government becomes too
				powerful, and that each branch serves as a check on the others. It is a
				fundamental aspect of the US system of government and helps to maintain
				the separation of powers and promote stability, accountability, and
				fairness. Examples of checks and balances in the US government include:
				<ul className="examples">
					<li>
						Legislative Branch: The legislative branch has the power to override
						a Presidential veto with a two-thirds vote, as well as the power to
						impeach and remove the President or federal judges from office.
					</li>
					<li>
						Executive Branch: The President has the power to veto laws passed by
						Congress, and to appoint federal judges and officials with the
						advice and consent of the Senat
					</li>
					<li>
						Judicial Branch: The judicial branch has the power of judicial
						review, allowing it to interpret the Constitution and declare acts
						of the legislative or executive branch unconstitutional.
					</li>
				</ul>
